      <span class="application">Tkinter</span> is a GUI (graphical user interface) widget set for
      Python.  This document was written for Python 2.7 and
      <span class="application">Tkinter</span> 8.5 running in the X Window system under Linux.
      Your version may vary.

      We'll start by looking at the visible part of <span class="application">Tkinter</span>:
      creating the widgets and arranging them on the screen.
      Later we will talk about how to connect the face—the
      “front panel”—of the application to
      the logic behind it.
